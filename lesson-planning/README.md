# W2D4 - Promises

In this lesson, we're going to build a simple HTTP client for interacting with
a JSON API. This is in order to fetch some data and answer questions that
interest us pertaining to that data. We're going to see two approaches for
making HTTP requests: one using the 'callback waterfall' method, and another
using promises.

## Learning goals

1. Define: JSON, API, callback waterfall.
2. Explain why JSON is a common data format for HTTP-based APIs.
3. Explain why the callback waterfall approach to async JS coding is
   undesirable, and how the promise approach addresses those problems.
4. Trace differet implementations of a simple HTTP client, whether implemented
   with callbacks or promises.

## Prerequisites

1. Students can list the steps in a common HTTP request/response cycle.
2. Students can list several JavaScript operations that are asynchronous, and
   explain why they are so.
3. Students can implement simple asynchronous JavaScript programs with
   callbacks.
