## API

- API is short for Application Program Interface

- There are a variety of possible APIs, but for our purposes today, we can think
  about them as HTTP servers that return data

    - This is different than HTTP servers that return web pages, that is, HTML
      pages (which usually will include HTML, CSS and JS code, as well as
      images, videos, and other media).

    - Lots of APIs return JSON data

    - But this is not a requirement; APIs can return any kind of data supported
      by HTTP

- APIs are built and maintained by all sorts of organizations who offer access
  to their data to other computer programs (sometimes for free, other times for
  a fee)

    - ex: [Dark Sky Weather API](https://darksky.net/poweredby/)
