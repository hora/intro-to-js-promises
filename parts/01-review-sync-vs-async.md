### Sync vs async code

What is synchronous code?

- executed sequentially, waits for one thing to finish
  before moving on from top to bottom (more-or-less)

What is asynchronous code?

- not synchronous

- sync code keeps executing while async code is waiting

    - for ex:
    - waiting for an event to be triggered
    - waiting for some time to pass (setTimeout,
      setInterval)

- callbacks are needed when working with async code
